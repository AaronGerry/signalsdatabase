- Companionship of technology, anthropomorphizing of robots/ machines (i.e., personality of services like Alexa and Siri: ["It’s so funny because I think ‘Oh wow, I am talking to a machine,’ but it doesn’t feel that way,”](http://www.wsj.com/articles/your-next-friend-could-be-a-robot-1476034599), affinity for robotic “pet” dogs, tools for elderly, baby robot that reads emotions)
- AI (governing body/ open source/ evil dictator usage, concrete challenges paper)
- Rise of smart machines/ systems/ robots (What are humans uniquely good at? What is our comparative advantage? And what is our place alongside these machines?)
- Open access to information/ MOOCs
- Disconnect/ Non-understanding of tech we use (loss of hard skills -> Romans forgetting how to build aqueducts)
- Sharing economy (part-time workers, labor as a service, changing social governance/ safety net, etc.)
- Rapid urbanization (slumification/ squatter cities, prediction of 80% urban in coming years, urban design (explore Alejandro Aravena further))
- Global warming/ Environmental shift impacting societies (rising water levels -> forcing landscape shift, changing rain patters -> water warfare, geo-engineering -> release SO2 into air to cool planet, atomizing ocean water, etc.)
- Sustainable energy production (Adoption of solar voltaics, reliance on oil/ sway in Washington. Impact of lobbying?, novel approaches( ie., harvesting electromagnetic waves in air))
- Local manufacturing/ production (micro-reactors, 3D printing, change from economies of scale?, open-source production)
- GMOs and modified organisms (resistant crops, bioluminescence -> light up trees instead of street lights, bacteria that produce cheese, open-source estrogen and insulin, hacking silkworms, synthetic biology)
- Genetically modified human (programmable children, life extension, personalized medicine)
- Future of food (lab grown meat/ eggs/ milk, etc., custom food based on your micro biome)
- Increasing needs of food production (growing population, desertification/ damaged farmable land, urban farming/ aeroponics (combo with swarming drones)/ aquaponics, sustainable/ resilient agriculture (biochar), local/ home agricultural production (3D printed food and candy, Soda Stream))
- More integrated supply chains (democratizing access to existing chains (ie., ColaLife), vulnerabilities in chain/ lack of monitoring)
- All digital shopping? (virtual shopping everywhere (ie., Tesco’s virtual grocery store in Korea, Starbucks car dashboard app) eliminate need to go to store/ JIT delivery or store pick up, eliminate need to make decision to order (ie., Amazon’s button, or refrigerators that know when milk is low)
- Increasing amount of free/ leisure time (connect with food: more home-cooked meals + products that help to learn (Blue Apron) + health + studies showing less mindful eating (HAPIfork) = bigger waistline //
- Altering senses and changing behavior (using VR to augment pain for burn victims, magnet in finger tip to feel magnetic fields, altering body/ how food tastes to move away from natural proclivities towards salt, fat, sugar/ tricking body to believe it’s eating something else by altering senses)
- Open-source governance (how Estonia is changing the game)
- Extensions beyond cryptocurrency, and how this can influence governance. Beyond government as we know it
- Automation again, cycle of impacts from automation technology
- Attention economy -> “push of the web/ push economy" (how FB algorithm works, contextualization of information, echo-chamber/ constructed thinking)
- Citizen scientists or cheap labor? (the changing dynamic of employee/ organization. Free agent society?, pooling of personal data (ie., PatientsLikeMe), organizational volunteering (i.e., Galaxy Zoo, Foldit), combo training and virtual bioengineering (amino labs), open-source robotic dogs for “sniff out” environmental toxins)
- Rapid displacement of low skill labor
- Distributed work/ Project-based organizations (replacement of managers with outsourcing software that divvy’s up work to specialists (CrowdFlower), remote workers/ contract workers (glance, upwork), shifting teams, mercenary economy/ what happens when we’re all piecing together identities among many crowds/ organizations?))
- Modern day isolation, tech, and the impact on tribalism/ biology
- Personalization of everything (custom fiction)
- Network: Integration of everything/ always connected (increased speed of coordination, IoT, implications with surveillance (who owns the information? preventative actions, ie., Minority Report/ public data (you) vs. crypto online data))
- Connected brain + AI/ cyborgization of people/ exo-cortex (plays with “push economy,” programmable people/ blurred lines of “true experiences” and augmented, what are your own thoughts?, diminished reliance on human/ animal senses (ie., reduced ability to pick up non-verbal cues), “what do I want to do today? -> “here is what you will want to do today”))
- Continued globalization and/ also Back to city state? (friction between governments/ jurisdiction of different municipalities (ie., state vs. city), bowdlerization of local/ geographical internets (ie., China))
- Specialized internet/ niche cloud supercomputer (ties in with specialized AI)
- Increasing lifespan (estimated that by 2025, the number of Americans over 60 will increase by 70%, Multiple careers will be commonplace and lifelong learning to prepare for occupational change)
- Accessibility of media (everyone creates (ie., snapchat, fan fiction, remixed movie trailers), fabricated sporting)
- Semblance of control built in as part of experience/ false agency (especially as it relates to “push economy,” idea virus/ ems of the Sumerian language (reference: Snow Crash))
- Changing definition of computers (ie., biological and quantum)
